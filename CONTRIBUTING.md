# Contributing to 3D Visualizer

🎉 Thank you for considering contributing to the 3D Visualizer project! Your feedback, ideas, and code make this project better for everyone.

## 🙌 How You Can Contribute

We welcome contributions in many forms:

- 🐛 Bug reports and suggestions
- 💡 Feature proposals
- ✍️ Improvements to documentation
- 🔧 Code enhancements and new modules
- 🧪 Demos or visual tests

## 🧰 Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork locally.
2. **Install dependencies**  
   - Python 3.8+  
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt` (coming soon)
   - Or just use your own Python environment as this project has minimal dependencies.

3. **Run the visualizer**  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:<PORT>` (port is printed when you run the app).

4. **Try the demo**  
   ```bash
   python demo/run_demo.py
   ```

## 🧑‍💻 Code Style and Practices

- Use **clear, descriptive names** for functions and variables.
- Prefer **modular, reusable code**.
- Stick to [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python and good structure for JS modules.
- Include meaningful **comments** where needed.
- Keep PRs **small and focused** — one feature or fix at a time.

## ✅ Pull Request Process

1. Open an issue first if you're working on something significant.
2. Create a new branch:  
   `git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-change`
3. Make your changes with care.
4. Run and test your update locally.
5. Commit your changes:  
   `git commit -m "Add: support for [your feature]"`
6. Push and open a pull request from your fork.

We'll review your PR and may offer feedback or suggestions before merging.
